## Agent Description

**Smart Contract Risk Scorer** is a Cloudflare Worker that analyzes smart contracts for security vulnerabilities and rug pull indicators across 5 chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base). It performs multi-source verification using Etherscan (source code), GoPlus Security, and Token Sniffer APIs, detects 20+ malicious patterns including honeypots, hidden mint/burn functions, fee manipulation, and proxy risks, and provides comprehensive risk scoring with confidence levels.

---

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base (5 chains)
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Block explorer APIs (Etherscan, Polygonscan, Arbiscan, Optimistic, BaseScan) for source code
  - GoPlus Security API for token security
  - Token Sniffer API for token scoring
- **Analysis Modes**: Quick (30s) and Deep (2-3 min) scans
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain/API status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /scan` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Contract Verification**: Fetch bytecode + source code from block explorer
2. **Proxy Detection**: Check for upgradeable patterns (ERC1967, UUPS)
3. **Source Code Analysis**: Scan 20+ malicious patterns (honeypots, hidden mint, fee manipulation, etc.)
4. **External Verification**: GoPlus Security + Token Sniffer cross-reference
5. **Ownership Analysis**: Check renouncement, timelock, multisig
6. **Honeypot Check**: Simulated buy/sell via router
6. **Risk Scoring**: Weighted scoring (critical=25, high=15, medium=8, low=3) with confidence
7. **Recommendations**: Actionable security advice

### Detected Patterns (20+)
- Honeypot: Balance manipulation, transfer blocking
- Hidden functions: Mint, burn, fee manipulation
- Access control: Ownership transfer, pause, blacklist
- Proxy risks: Upgradeable contracts, delegatecall
- Dangerous patterns: selfdestruct, tx.origin, delegatecall
- Fee manipulation: Dynamic fees, exclusion lists

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types.ts` | Shared types (RiskScanRequest, RiskScanResponse, Vulnerability, etc.) |
| `src/chains.ts` | Chain configs (5 chains) + analysis engine (proxy, honeypot, patterns, external APIs) |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain/API status |
| `src/scan_endpoint.ts` | x402 /scan endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |

---

## Verification

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- **Tests**: `npm test` — ✅ 8 tests PASS
