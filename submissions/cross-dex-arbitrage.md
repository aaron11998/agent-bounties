## Agent Description

**Cross DEX Arbitrage Alert** is a Cloudflare Worker that detects profitable cross-DEX arbitrage opportunities after accounting for DEX fees and gas costs. It scans Uniswap V2/V3 and SushiSwap V2 across 5 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon) to find price spreads exceeding a minimum threshold, calculates net profit after gas, and returns the best routes with verified cost estimates.

---

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon (5 chains)
- **DEXes**: Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap V2 (13 DEX-chain combos)
- **Storage**: No persistent storage (stateless queries)
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain/DEX status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /arbitrage` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Arbitrage Logic
1. **Chain Selection**: Scan specified chains (default: all 5)
2. **DEX Pairing**: Check all DEX pairs per chain for direct arbitrage
3. **Quote Fetching**: Get on-chain quotes via router/quoter contracts
4. **Spread Calculation**: Net spread = (amountOut - amountIn) / amountIn
5. **Gas Estimation**: Per-DEX gas costs converted to USD
6. **Profit Filtering**: Only routes with positive net profit after gas
7. **Route Ranking**: Sort by net profit USD descending

| `src/arbitrage.ts` | Arbitrage engine (V2/V3 quotes, gas estimation, profit calc) |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain/DEX status |
| `src/arbitrage_endpoint.ts` | x402 /arbitrage endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |
