## Agent Description

**LP Impermanent Loss Estimator** is a Cloudflare Worker that calculates impermanent loss (IL) and fee APR estimates for any LP position or simulated deposit on major AMMs across 7 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche). It queries on-chain pool reserves/liquidity, computes IL using the standard formula, estimates fee APR from 24h volume and fees, and returns comprehensive metrics including HODL vs LP value comparison.

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (7 chains)
- **AMMs**: Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap V2, Curve, Balancer (configurable)
- **Data Sources**: On-chain RPC queries (reserves, liquidity, slot0)
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /il` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Calculation Logic
1. **Pool Discovery**: Lookup pool in known registry (10+ major pools) or query factory
2. **Metrics Fetch**: 
   - V2: `getReserves()` → reserve0, reserve1
   - V3: `slot0()` + `liquidity()` → sqrtPriceX96, liquidity
3. **IL Formula**: `IL = 2 * sqrt(priceRatio) / (1 + priceRatio) - 1`
   - priceRatio = (reserve1/reserve0)_current / (reserve1/reserve0)_initial
4. **Fee APR**: `APR = (volume24h * feeBps/10000 * 365) / TVL * 100`
5. **Value Comparison**: HODL value vs LP value with IL loss in USD

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types.ts` | Shared types (ILRequest, ILResult, PoolMetrics, PoolConfig, etc.) |
| `src/chains.ts` | Chain configs (7 chains) + known pools (10+) + IL/fee engines |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain status |
| `src/il_endpoint.ts` | x402 /il endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |

---

## Verification

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- **Tests**: `npm test` — ✅ 14 tests PASS (chains: 7, IL math: 3, fee APR: 2, pool lookup: 2)
