## Agent Description

**GasRoute Oracle** is a Cloudflare Worker that returns the cheapest chain and optimal timing for a given transaction by analyzing live gas prices across 7 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche). It queries real-time gas oracles via RPC, calculates fees in USD accounting for calldata size and priority level, and provides congestion-aware confirmation time estimates.

---

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (7 chains)
- **Gas Sources**: RPC eth_feeHistory (Ethereum), eth_gasPrice (L2s), native gas oracles
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /gas` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Estimation Logic
1. **Chain Selection**: Filter configured chains (RPC URLs provided via env)
2. **Gas Price Fetch**: Query each chain's gas oracle (eth_feeHistory for EIP-1559)
3. **Fee Calculation**: 
   - `totalGas = gasUnitsEst + calldataSizeBytes * 16`
   - `feeWei = totalGas * effectiveGasPriceGwei * 1e9`
   - `feeUsd = (feeWei / 1e18) * nativeTokenPriceUsd`
4. **Congestion Analysis**: Busy level thresholds per chain
5. **Time Estimation**: `confirmTime = busyMultiplier * blockTime`
6. **Route Ranking**: Weighted score (70% cost, 30% speed)

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types.ts` | Shared types (GasRequest, GasResponse, ChainGasEstimate, etc.) |
| `src/chains.ts` | Chain configs (7 chains) + gas estimation engine |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain status |
| `src/gas_endpoint.ts` | x402 /gas endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |

## Verification

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- **Tests**: `npm test` — ✅ 7 tests PASS

## Deployment

```bash
cd /Users/prajwalmendonca/Dolly/paperclip/gasroute-oracle
wrangler secret put ETHEREUM_RPC_URL
