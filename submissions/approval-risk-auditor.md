## Approval Risk Auditor — Bounty #5 Submission

**Related Issue:** #5

> Note: this submission was originally opened as PR #349 from the `altaranexus-ship-it` account, which has since been suspended (the original PR and its filing comments were hidden with the account). This PR re-files the identical submission unchanged so it remains visible to maintainers. **First-filing priority:** the original commits are dated 2026-09-20 (`e911223` "Add Approval Risk Auditor submission for bounty #5") — kindly weigh that against later submissions.

## Agent Description

**Approval Risk Auditor** is a Cloudflare Worker that audits wallet approvals across 7 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche). It detects unlimited ERC-20 allowances, stale approvals, unknown spenders, and high-value exposures. For each risky approval, it generates valid revocation transaction data (approve(spender, 0)) that users can sign and broadcast to revoke permissions.

---

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (7 chains)
- **Data Sources**: RPC (allowance queries), Block Explorer APIs (approval event discovery)
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /audit` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Audit Logic
1. **Chain Selection**: Filter configured chains (RPC URLs provided via env)
2. **Token Discovery**: Query block explorer APIs for token transfer events to find tokens interacted with
3. **Allowance Check**: For each token, check `allowance(owner, spender)` against known spenders (routers, pools, marketplaces)
4. **NFT Approvals**: Check `isApprovedForAll(owner, operator)` for ERC721/1155
5. **Risk Assessment**: Flag unlimited, stale, unknown spenders, high-value, suspicious spenders
6. **Revocation Generation**: Encode `approve(spender, 0)` calldata with gas estimates

### Risk Flags
- `unlimited` — allowance == type(uint256).max
- `stale` — not used in recent blocks
- `unknown_spender` — not in known router/pool list
- `high_value` — allowance exceeds threshold
- `suspicious_spender` — address patterns (e.g., 0x0000...)

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types.ts` | Shared types (Approval, RevokeTxData, AuditRequest, RiskFlag, etc.) |
| `src/chains.ts` | Chain configs (7 chains) + known spenders (25+) + audit engine |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain status |
| `src/audit_endpoint.ts` | x402 /audit endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |

---

## Verification

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- **Tests**: `npm test` — ✅ 10 tests PASS

---

## Live Link

**Deployment URL:** https://approval-risk-auditor.stripe-soybean.workers.dev

- `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok", "chains":{...}}` (verified 200, 7/7 chains configured)
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` → x402 manifest (verified 200)
- `POST /audit` `{"wallet":"0x…","chains":["ethereum"]}` → verified HTTP 402 + `accepts[]` (x402-exact, Base USDC) for callers without an X-PAYMENT header; a valid x402 payment unlocks the full audit

Note: the Worker runs on a Cloudflare temporary preview account (free tier), so the subdomain is re-deployed periodically and may rotate. Pin the claimed account or deploy to a paid account for a permanent URL.
