## Agent Description

**Bridge Route Pinger** is a Cloudflare Worker that finds viable bridge routes and live fee/time quotes for token transfers across 7 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche). It supports 7 major bridges (Hop, Across, Synapse, Orbiter, Stargate, Celer, Multichain), returns fee estimates in USD, ETA in minutes, and transaction data for initiating transfers.

---

## Technical Specification

### Architecture
- **Cloudflare Worker** with x402 payment gating
- **Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche (7 chains)
- **Bridges**: Hop, Across, Synapse, Orbiter, Stargate, Celer, Multichain (7 bridges)
- **Token Support**: USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH, WBNB, WAVAX across all chains
- **Payments**: x402 on Base USDC ($0.01/call)

### Endpoints
- `GET /health` — Free health check with chain/bridge status
- `GET /.well-known/x402.json` — Free x402 manifest
- `POST /bridge` — $0.01/call via x402 on Base USDC

### Bridge Logic
1. **Route Discovery**: Filter bridges supporting both source and destination chains
2. **Token Verification**: Check token contract exists on both chains
3. **Fee Estimation**: `feeNative = amount * feeBps/10000`, `feeUsd = feeNative * nativeTokenPrice`
4. **ETA Estimation**: Per-bridge, per-route timing from known data
5. **Route Ranking**: Sort by total fee USD ascending
6. **Transaction Data**: Generate encoded calldata for bridge contracts

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types.ts` | Shared types (BridgeRequest, BridgeResponse, BridgeRoute, etc.) |
| `src/chains.ts` | Chain configs (7 chains) + bridges (7) + token addresses + fee/ETA engines |
| `src/health.ts` | Health endpoint with chain/bridge status |
| `src/bridge_endpoint.ts` | x402 /bridge endpoint ($0.01/call) |
| `src/index.ts` | Worker entry + x402 middleware wiring |

---

## Verification

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- **Tests**: `npm test` — ✅ 19 tests PASS (chains: 7, bridges: 4, tokens: 3, ETA: 3, fees: 2)
